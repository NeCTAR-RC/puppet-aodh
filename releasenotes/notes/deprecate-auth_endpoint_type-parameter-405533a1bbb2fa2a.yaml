fixes:
  - When trying to specify the endpoint type in the identity service catalog to
    use for communication with OpenStack services an outdated configuration
    option was written.
deprecations:
  - aodh::auth::auth_endpoint_type is deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. Please use aodh::auth::interface instead.
