deprecations:
  - aodh::api::host and aodh::api::port are deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. aodh-api itself is for testing only and does not use these
    parameters. The production-ready alternative aodh::wsgi::apache supports
    setting host and port via the bind_host and port parameters.
